We are going to add two features:
- viewer mode will now require a password to access the stream, password will be live generated in a word _ separated with 3 words
- on the left view of the viewer mode will be the transcript
- on the right view of the viewer mode will be a live summary
- The live summary will be using the actual state of the meeting transcript file, and once a minute we will generate a new summary helping somone to see what we discussed so far, the key points; open question etc.
- Ideally the summary should be splitted into: big points of the meeting discussed so far, focussing on essential/consice; last minutes/current discussion item more detailed
- The summary will be displayed in the language of the choice of the user on the right side of his view

● All features have been implemented. Let me provide a summary of what was done:

  Summary of Changes

  1. Viewer Password Protection

  - Added 3-word passphrase generation (word_word_word format) at app startup
  - Passphrase is displayed in admin console and admin UI
  - Viewers must enter passphrase before accessing translations
  - Session storage remembers authentication

  2. Redesigned Viewer Interface (templates/viewer.html)

  - Password screen - First screen viewers see
  - Language selection - After authentication
  - Split layout view:
    - Left panel: Live translations in selected language
    - Right panel: Live summary with:
        - Key Points section (bullet points of main discussion)
      - Current Discussion section (detailed current topic)

  3. Live Summary Generation

  - Uses local Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct model (~1.5GB VRAM)
  - Generates summary every 60 seconds (configurable)
  - Structured output: key points + current topic
  - Summary is translated to each viewer's selected language

  4. Admin Panel Updates (templates/admin.html)

  - Shows viewer passphrase with copy button
  - Passphrase displayed prominently in header
